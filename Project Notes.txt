//ALL DONE//

CSS
Work out how to get everything where it needs to be on the page
maybe using grids

needs to take up whole page with rows

i think im having problems with creating a grid that spans the whole page because my gid container is within another element but i cant make the parent element the container as i wont be able to style the list items how id like. i cant discard the use of an unordered list in the nav as that would diminish accessibility so i need to find a way around this. 
ive tried making the nav span the whole page but this isnt working

grids/ flex for every level to position and then make nav bigger/ span more rows to take up more of the page

//SORTED (changed body display to flexbox)
//UNSORTED 
the only ay i can overlat the header is with grids but that means the nav ul doesnt take up the whole page like i want it too

//SORTED AGAIN
It doesnt need to because once ive gotten rid of the background colours im using for positioning, i wont matter if it stretches to the edge of the page

proj nav pages 7r 8c

Need to design about me page and then i can commit styling

grow back buttons on hover java
