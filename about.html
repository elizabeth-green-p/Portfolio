    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>Objectives and goals</h2>
    <p>I have always had a strong interest in computing and technology since we got our first computer in 1999.<br>
        Exploring the the file systems of that first computer gave me a glimpse of how the systenms ere organised and how they worked<br>
        The more i learned about computers the more i felt a certain kinship with the logical aspect of programming as well as a certain pride when i learned how to manipulate systmes to achieve small goals.<br>
        As a queer person of colour, I am inspired by great thinkers and trailblazers like Alan Turing and Margot Lee Shepperly for their contrinutions to the fiel as well as the multitudes of unnamed queer people and people of colour who worked to achieve the milestones in computing we have had so far.<br>
        I see technology as a means of not only carrying out comlicated tasks but assisting people in achieveing similar tasks. In this I think technology can and should be focused on not only being accessible to all but assistive to all so that we can move forward and achieve great things in spite of any societal barriers that stand in the way.<br>
        My goals in the tech field are to combine these two ideas in o one. I wish to further the legacy of those before me who worked tirelessly to improve our understanding of technology and to utilise those achievements to make the world more accessible for anyone regardless of ability or economics<br>
        Technology is a tool but it is also a philosophy. Together with our innate human spirit, and the natural world around us, I believe technology can improve society for everyone </p>
